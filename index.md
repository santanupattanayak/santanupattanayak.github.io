##  Welcome to Santanu's EigenTalks 

Welcome to my Blog space "Symmetries and Signals" where I unpack techniques and concepts in machine learning, optimization and genAI with a mathematical touch to them . Whether you're here for a deep dive into diffusion models or a quick intuition on vanishing gradients, I hope you find something that sparks curiosity.
